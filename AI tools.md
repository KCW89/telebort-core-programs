1. Gradio
What It Is:
Gradio is a platform that lets you build interactive machine learning demos with just a few lines of Python code.
How It Fits:
• In a module on “Customizing and Interacting with AI,” students can use Gradio to create simple apps—such as a greeting chatbot or an image classifier—demonstrating how models work and making abstract concepts tangible.
• Its ease of setup and ability to share live demos make it ideal for classroom presentations.

2. Project Shuwa’s Signtown
What It Is:
Although Signtown requires JavaScript to run, it’s presented as a creative online project where users can explore interactive digital art.
How It Fits:
• This tool can serve as a case study in a module about “Generative Creativity,” showing how AI can be used to remix or reimagine visual designs.
• Teachers can encourage students to explore the interface (with proper browser settings) and discuss how interactivity and visual aesthetics are generated by AI.

3. Google NotebookLM
What It Is:
NotebookLM is Google’s AI-powered note-taking and research assistant that helps users organize ideas and collaborate on projects.
How It Fits:
• It’s perfect for a module on “AI in Everyday Productivity,” where students learn how AI tools can aid research, brainstorming, and organizing creative projects.
• By using NotebookLM, students can practice summarizing information and keeping digital notebooks—all essential skills in today’s tech‑driven world.

4. Sora
What It Is:
Sora is OpenAI’s text‑to‑video generator that transforms descriptive text prompts into short, dynamic video clips.
How It Fits:
• For older or more advanced students (typically ages 14–16), Sora can be introduced in a module on “Multimodal AI Creativity.”
• Students can see how language models extend beyond static images by generating simple videos, sparking discussions about the challenges and creative possibilities of AI‑driven video production.

5. Other “Imagine” Generation Tools
What They Are:
This category includes a range of generative AI tools—such as various text‑to‑image and even text‑to‑video applications—that allow users to create visual content from simple prompts.
How They Fit:
• These tools can be showcased as optional projects where students choose one (or more) to create digital art, illustrations, or even comic strips.
• Such activities help students learn about the importance of prompt engineering and the creative potential of AI while ensuring they understand the limitations (e.g., occasional inaccuracies) of these technologies.

Bringing It All Together
By incorporating these platforms into your curriculum, you provide students with multiple entry points to explore GenAI:

Interactive Demos (Gradio): Build and share simple ML apps.
Creative Exploration (Signtown & Imagine Tools): Remix and generate digital art.
Practical Productivity (NotebookLM): Organize research and creative ideas.
Cutting‑Edge Multimedia (Sora): Explore text‑to‑video generation for storytelling.
This blended approach not only makes learning about generative AI engaging and hands‑on but also empowers students to see how these tools can be applied both creatively and practically in their everyday lives.

Feel free to adapt the pace and depth of each module based on your students’ interests and technical backgrounds. Happy teaching!
