   - 24 lessons over 6 months
   - 1-hour weekly sessions
   - 1:8 teacher-student ratio
   - Focus on database fundamentals from basics to advanced topics

2. Help me create detailed lesson materials following this format for each lesson:
   | Program | Lesson & Topic | Objectives | To do (Activity) | Questions to ask (Understanding) |
   |---------|---------------|------------|------------------|----------------------------------|

3. For each lesson, please:
   - Break down complex topics into clear learning objectives
   - Suggest practical hands-on activities
   - Create assessment questions that test understanding
   - Maintain progression from basic to advanced concepts
   - Include both theoretical knowledge and practical skills

4. Ensure all content:
   - Is appropriate for a 1-hour session
   - Includes hands-on exercises with SQLite/MongoDB
   - Features clear learning outcomes
   - Has measurable assessment criteria



===========================
Prompting Template, step 2
===========================
Very good, now let's be specific, first, learn about the writing format for our other program. We are going to come out with Lesson & Topic, Objectives, and Questions to ask the students before they leave the classroom (Understanding). 

This is one of the ways we write our learning material.

Lesson & Topic		
Lesson 1: Introduction to AI	

Objectives: To understand AI
- To understand the definition of AI and its techniques
- To learn about the history of AI
- To explore different AI tools in our daily lives
- To understand AI ethics, benefits, and limitations"	

Questions to ask the student, before they leave the classroom (Understanding)
"To understand AI
- Can you think of any AI techniques and AI benefits?
- Can you think of any AI tools you know throughout history?
- Can you tell me why there is a thing such as AI winter?
- Can you think of any AI tools that is around us today?
- How do you ensure that AI works that follows ethics and requirements?"
